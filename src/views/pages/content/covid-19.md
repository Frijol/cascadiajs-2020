## April 17, 2020 Update

Due to the uncertain situation regarding COVID-19 we have decided to transition CascadiaJS 2020 to a <span class="highlight warning">fully on-line virtual event</span>. 

This decision was not made lightly, but ultimately it did not feel right to continue to sell tickets and ask people to book flights and lodging for a large, in-person gathering this year. 

While we were all looking forward to seeing you in Oregon, we are excited about making CascadiaJS available to more people, especially those who might not have been able to join us this year because of the cost or the logistics involved in getting to Sunriver. We have already started to think about how to translate the magic of CascadiaJS to a virtual format and how to take advantage of technology to deliver experiences we could never have done in person.

We know why you come to CascadiaJS. It's not just about listening to talks. It's about seeing old friends and making new ones. It's about checking out new technology. It's about starting to think about what's next in your career, or maybe even finding folks who are passionate about JavaScript to join your team! And it's definitely about relaxing, having fun, and getting away from work for a couple of days. We know this, and we are going to make this happen for you in September. <u>On the Internet</u> <i class="fa fa-globe"></i>.

In light of the dynamic, rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation around the world, we&#39;re sharing an update and FAQ with the CascadiaJS community so that you all can plan appropriately. The CascadiaJS organizers are monitoring the COVID-19 situation daily to ensure the safety of our attendees, speakers, and staff. We plan on updating this page on a regular basis.
