# COVID-19 Updates

In light of the dynamic, rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation around the world, we wanted to share an update and FAQ with the CascadiaJS community so that you all can plan appropriately. The CascadiaJS organizers are currently monitoring the COVID-19 situation daily to ensure the safety of our attendees, speakers, and staff. With this mind, we plan on updating this page on a regular basis.

First and foremost, we are still planning on holding CascadiaJS 2020 at Sunriver Resort on Sept 1-2. We are in constant contact with Sunriver Resort and they are publishing information on the [actions they are taking](https://www.destinationhotels.com/sunriver-resort/resort/coronavirus-actions) to make sure that guests are safe when they visit. At the moment they are closed until May 15.

## Is the conference still happening?

Yes.

## What safety precautions will you take on-site?

At a minimum we will:

* Work with health care professionals and the venue to ensure a safe experience for everyone.
* Have hand sanitizer stationed at throughout the conference.
* Will be actively sanitizing all speaker microphones between talks.
* Ask that anyone that believes they may have been exposed to the Coronavirus or is feeling sick to refrain from attending in person for the safety of other attendees.
* We will send emails to registered event participants with health updates, leading up to the conference event. 

## Will there be a way to attend the conference virtually?

Yes! In addition to a live stream, we will put in the work to make CascadiaJS 2020 a hybrid conference. We will endeavor to create an experience for remote attendees that is as close to "being there" as humanly possible. Ticket pricing and more details coming soon.

## Are tickets refundable?

No, but we will issue partial refunds in two cases:


1. If you may have been exposed to the Coronavirus or are feeling sick, we will issue a partial refund and ask that you attend remotely.
2. If we cannot host the conference on-site and go completely virtual, we will issue partial refunds (see below).

## What happens if it isn't possible to host the conference at Sunriver Resort on Sept 1-2?

There are two possibilities:

1. We will postpone to a future date in 2020. Accomodations will be transferred to the new dates.
2. The 2020 conference will go 100% virtual.

## If the conference is postponed, can people get a refund?

No, but your tickets will be valid for the new dates. Tickets are also fully transferable. 

## If the conference goes virtual, can people get a refund?

We will process a partial refund for the difference between what was paid and the cost of a ticket to the virtual conference.

## Is there any chance the conference will be cancelled altogether?

No, we will either execute on-time, postpone to a later date or go virtual in 2020. No matter what, there will be an awesome CascadiaJS experience this year!

## Does this affect the Call for Presenters?

Yes, we have decided to extend the [CFP](/cpf) deadline to <span class="highlight warning">April 27</span>.
