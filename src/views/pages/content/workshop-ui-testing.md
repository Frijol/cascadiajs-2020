As testing continues to shift left, developers are testing more code early in the software development pipeline. While shifting left provides significant benefits, it also creates bottlenecks earlier in the pipeline - in a 2020 developer survey by GitLab, testing was identified as the number one reason for delays.

In response to the testing bottleneck, a number of open source, developer-focused solutions have emerged. In this workshop, Sauce Labs Senior Software Engineer Dan Graham will discuss some of the most popular solutions: Cypress, Playwright, Puppeteer, TestCafe, and Selenium. Heâ€™ll then take a closer look at Cypress, with a tutorial and hands-on training on the framework.

For even more streamlined and speedy tests, Dan will also demo a new containerized testing solution from Sauce Labs, the Sauce Testrunner Toolkit. The Testrunner Toolkit simplifies user setup, speeds up test execution time, and supports Cypress, TestCafe, Puppeteer, and Playwright, helping developers unstick the testing bottleneck and achieve quality at scale.
