For those of you who attended CascadiaJS 2014 in Portland, OR, you will no doubt remember the amazing Closing Party we hosted at [Voicebox Portland](https://voiceboxkaraoke.com/locations/southeast-portland/). The folks at Voicebox know how to create amazing karaoke experiences and they totally get web developers because they *are* web developers. They even built their very own [Karaoke REST API](https://voiceboxkaraoke.com/api/v1/documentation.html)!

In a post-COVID world, the folks at Voicebox Karaoke will help us put on the very best virtual karaoke experience possible. We can't wait to hear what songs you sing!
