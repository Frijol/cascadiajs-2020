## Mentorship Panel

New to tech? Or maybe experienced and also searching for someone who can mentor you and help you grow? We will host a panel of experts that will answer your questions and then break-up into smaller groups (< 6 people) where a wonderful group of mentors from our community will continue the conversation.

## Venturing Out

Have you ever thought about leaving "Big Tech" and starting a company, but you didn't know how? Ken Horenstein from [Venture Out](https://ventureoutstartups.com/) will host a fireside chat with an engineer who left their job at a big tech company and they will share their experience venturing out and starting something new!

For folks who are already going down this path:

1. Applications are open for the [Launch Lab](https://ventureoutstartups.com/launch).
2. Join the [Founder's Forum](https://ventureoutstartups.com/founder-forums) to connect with a community of founders who support each other.

## Remo

Remo is a virtual event platform that allow us to create a floor that has tables and chairs. Each table can accommodate a maximum of 6 people, and once you "sit down" you will be in a video chat (video + audio) with the other people seated at that table.

A few instructions on how to use Remo:
- When you enter the event, make sure to turn-on your camera and microphone (buttons at the bottom)
- Take a second to edit your profile (upper right) and upload a photo and set your display name
- Double-click on a chair to "sit down" and join the video chat
- Click on "Tile View" to make everyone's video big
- Click on "Floor Plan View" to shrink the videos and reveal the floor plan

A few tips on getting the most out of the event:
- Be a good listener, don't dominate the conversation
- Remember the two feet rule: feel free to leave a table whenever you like.
- Remember the Pacman rule: always try to leave a chair open at your table, if possible.
