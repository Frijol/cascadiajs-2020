## Remo

Remo is a virtual event platform that allow us to create a floor that has tables and chairs. Each table can accommodate a maximum of 6 people, and once you "sit down" you will be in a video chat (video + audio) with the other people seated at that table.

A few instructions on how to use Remo:
- When you enter the event, make sure to turn-on your camera and microphone (buttons at the bottom)
- Take a second to edit your profile (upper right) and upload a photo and set your display name
- Double-click on a chair to "sit down" and join the video chat
- Click on "Tile View" to make everyone's video big
- Click on "Floor Plan View" to shrink the videos and reveal the floor plan

A few tips on getting the most out of the event:
- Be a good listener, don't dominate the conversation
- Remember the two feet rule: feel free to leave a table whenever you like.
- Remember the Pacman rule: always try to leave a chair open at your table, if possible.
