We also encourage you to join the **#live** channel on [our Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/cascadiajs/shared_invite/enQtNzYzMzYxMTc0OTc5LWM0ZDZiZDc5MDgwMmFkODdlZTdiMGE3NjFhYTZmNWVkMWEwMDcxNWE0Nzg5YTcwOGQzZDk0Y2M3ZWRmN2QwNzU). That's where you will be able to hang out with fellow attendees and ask questions during the Q&A portion.

For your convenience, we will also be displaying the Slack chat conversation on the website in read-only mode next to the live stream.

#### Part 2: Hanging out in Remo

Following the conclusion of the talks and Q&A, we will be asking everyone to join us over on Remo. 

Remo is a virtual event platform that allow us to create a floor that has tables and chairs. Each table can accommodate a maximum of 6 people, and once you "sit down" you will be in a video chat (video + audio) with the other people seated at that table.

A few instructions on how to use Remo:
- When you enter the event, make sure to turn-on your camera and microphone (buttons at the bottom)
- Take a second to edit your profile (upper right) and upload a photo and set your display name
- Double-click on a chair to "sit down" and join the video chat
- Click on "Tile View" to make everyone's video big
- Click on "Floor Plan View" to shrink the videos and reveal the floor plan

A few tips on getting the most out of the event:
- Be a good listener, don't dominate the conversation
- Remember the two feet rule: feel free to leave a table whenever you like.
- Remember the Pacman rule: always try to leave a chair open at your table, if possible.
