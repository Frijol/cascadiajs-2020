## I think I got the wrong hoodie?

If you think you got the wrong hoodie, here's what you can do to sort this out:

1) Look at the swag box. It should have a sticker label on the outside. There was an error printing labels, so if yours says "Women's", just consider that to be the same thing as "Fitted".

2) Find the email receipt you got from customerservice@kotisdesign.com. It should look like the image below:

There were 3 kinds of hoodies that you could order: Fitted, Unisex and Youth.

If the hoodie you got doesn't match what you see in your email receipt, please email customerservice@kotisdesign.com to get assistance on correcting this.

If the hoodie you got matches what you see in your email receipt, you still have the option of [purchasing another hoodie](https://stores.kotisdesign.com/cascadiajshoodie/products). You will need to do this by Sept 2 at the latest.
