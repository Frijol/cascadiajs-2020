You might have noticed “FOSTIVE” on our photo app. And hopefully you’ve enjoyed the emote app. Both of these are part of a new open source project called FOSTIVE.

FOSTIVE stands for Free and Open Source Tools for Incredible Virtual Events, and it is just that! The Heroku and Salesforce Developer Relations team created these because we weren’t satisfied with the virtual event experience. We wanted to make it more engaging, more human, for both attendees and organizers.

Then we realized we could help more events by open sourcing these tools, and we could best get the word out by announcing FOSTIVE at an event whose attendees love open source, like CascadiaJS.

Please help us out! You can:

- Share FOSTIVE with other event organizers
- Fix bugs
- Add requested features to existing repos
- Create a new tool in a new repo based on one of the ideas in the unimplemented ideas list
- Write / improve docs
- [Suggest new app ideas](https://github.com/fostive/unimplemented-ideas)
- Use a FOSTIVE tool at your local meetup

Learn more about the project, spread the word, and help us all make virtual events better.
